# ESP32-Projects

This repository contains several ESP32 projects developed using Arduino IDE and various IoT frameworks like Blynk and RemoteXY. Each project focuses on different functionalities, from basic LED control using a web server to more advanced applications like creating custom user interfaces for remote control.

## Projects

### 1. Web Server LED Control

Control an LED connected to ESP32 through a web server interface. This project demonstrates basic web server setup, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and Arduino IDE for ESP32 programming.

### 2. Blynk Application Integration

Integrates the ESP32 with the Blynk IoT platform to create a mobile application interface for device control. Features real-time data monitoring and remote control capabilities.

### 3. RemoteXY Custom User Interface

Creates a custom user interface using RemoteXY for intuitive control of ESP32-connected devices via a smartphone app. Ideal for creating personalized control panels with minimal coding.

### 4. Web Server Calculator

Develops a web-based calculator accessible over a local WiFi network. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations through a simple web interface hosted on the ESP32.
